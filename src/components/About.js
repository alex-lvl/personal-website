        Hello! My name is Alex Marmolejo and I am a self-taught Full-Stack
        Javascript Developer based in New York. I am particularly focused on the
        MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). I am skilled in
        creating visually appealing web pages with attention to detail. My
        educational backround in accounting, finance, and taxes, allows me to
        bring a unique perspective to web development. I believe programming is
        a powerful tool which can be used to create technology that
        simplifies people's lives. Therefore, I would be excited to have the
        oppurtunity to work on technology that impacts the lives of many!

        Aside from coding, I enjoy various activities across the internet in my
        free time. I enjoy playing video games in a variety of genres or viewing
        the artistic storytelling of anime(japanese animation). Additionally,
        exploring the new iteration of the internet, web3, has become a recent
        interest of mine. In relation to web3/cryptocurrency, investing and
        trading in stocks or cryptocurrencies is an active hobby I have
        participated in since my college years. I try to

        assets.
