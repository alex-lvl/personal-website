        Hello! My name is Alex Marmolejo and I am a self-taught Full-Stack
        Javascript Developer based in New York. I am particularly focused on the
        MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and, I am skilled
        in creating visually appealing web pages with attention to detail. My
        educational background in accounting, specifically my experience with
        taxes, as well as my knowledge of finance and financial markets, allows
        me to bring a unique perspective to web development. I believe
        programming is a powerful tool that can be used to create technology
        that simplifies people's lives and I am excited to pursue a career in
        web development to create technology for the world!
      </p>

        Aside from coding, I enjoy various activities across the internet in my
        free time. I enjoy playing video games in a variety of genres or viewing
        the artistic storytelling of anime(japanese animation). Additionally,
        exploring the new iteration of the internet, web3, has become a recent
        interest of mine. In relation to web3/cryptocurrency, investing and
        trading in stocks or cryptocurrencies is an active hobby I have
        participated in since my college years. I try to blog about interesting
        economic events and how they affect the price of these assets so, make
        sure to{" "}
